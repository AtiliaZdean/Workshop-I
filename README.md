# Residential Cleaning Service Reservation System

## Overview

This project is a command-line-based **reservation system** designed for managing residential cleaning services. It was developed as part of my **Workshop I** coursework, applying key concepts from my **Bachelor of Computer Science (Database Management)** studies, including **structured analysis, relational database design, and system integration**.

## Key Features

- **User Registration & Authentication** â€“ Secure modules for both customers and staff.  
- **Reservation Management** â€“ Allows users to book cleaning services while automating cost calculations for accuracy.  
- **Feedback System** â€“ Enables customers to submit service ratings and comments for quality improvement.  
- **Error Handling & Validation** â€“ Implements robust input validation (e.g., date verification, password rules) to enhance system stability.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Development Environment:** Command-line interface  
- **Database Concepts Applied:** Relational schema design, normalization, and structured system analysis  

## SDG Alignment

- **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** â€“ By improving residential cleaning service management, this system contributes to healthier living environments and enhances service efficiency in urban areas.

## Future Improvements

- Develop a **GUI version** for better usability.  
- Integrate with a **persistent database** instead of file-based storage.  
- Expand features for **reservation cancellation** and **modification options**.
