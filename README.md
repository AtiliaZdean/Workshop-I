# Residential Cleaning Service Reservation System

## Overview

This project is a command-line-based **reservation system** designed for managing residential cleaning services. It was developed as part of my **Workshop I** coursework, applying key concepts from my **Bachelor of Computer Science (Database Management)** studies, including **structured analysis, relational database design, and system integration**.

## Key Features

- **User Registration & Authentication** – Secure modules for both customers and staff.  
- **Reservation Management** – Allows users to book cleaning services while automating cost calculations for accuracy.  
- **Feedback System** – Enables customers to submit service ratings and comments for quality improvement.  
- **Error Handling & Validation** – Implements robust input validation (e.g., date verification, password rules) to enhance system stability.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Development Environment:** Command-line interface  
- **Database Concepts Applied:** Relational schema design, normalization, and structured system analysis  

## SDG Alignment

- **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** – By improving residential cleaning service management, this system contributes to healthier living environments and enhances service efficiency in urban areas.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler (such as GCC or MSVC)  
- Basic command-line knowledge  

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtiliaZdean/Workshop-I.git
   cd Workshop-I
   ```
2. **Compile the Application:**  
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o ReservationSystem
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**  
   ```bash
   ./ReservationSystem
   ```
4. **Usage:** Follow the on-screen prompts for registration, booking a service, and submitting feedback.

## Future Improvements

- Develop a **GUI version** for better usability.  
- Integrate with a **persistent database** instead of file-based storage.  
- Expand features for **reservation cancellation** and **modification options**.
